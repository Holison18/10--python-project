# 21 Number Game

This is a simple implementation of the 21 Number Game in Python. The game is played between a player and a computer, where both take turns selecting a number between 1 and 10. The goal of the game is to be the first to reach a total sum of 21 without exceeding it.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in your Python environment.

2. You will be prompted to choose who starts the game, either Player 1 or the Computer.

3. Player 1 and the Computer take turns making their moves.

4. Player 1 enters a number between 1 and 10 when it's their turn.

5. The Computer selects a number randomly between 1 and 10, taking care not to exceed the target.

6. The game continues until one of the players reaches a total sum of 21 or until both players run out of moves.

7. The player who reaches 21 first is declared the winner.

## Game Rules

- Each player has a limited number of moves (defined by `totalMoves`).
- The Computer makes random moves with the constraint of not exceeding the target.
- Player 1 must enter a valid number between 1 and 10.
- The game ends when one of the players reaches a total sum of 21 or when both players run out of moves.

## Code Structure

- `toggle_player(current_player)`: A function to toggle between Player 1 and the Computer.
- `computer()`: Function to simulate the Computer's move.
- `player1()`: Function to get input from Player 1.
- `start()`: Function to initialize and control the game.

## Dependencies

The game uses the `random` module for generating random numbers.

## Enjoy the Game!

Have fun playing the 21 Number Game and see if you can outsmart the Computer to reach 21 before it does!
